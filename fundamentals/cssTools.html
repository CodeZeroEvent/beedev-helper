        <h2>Box Model</h2>
        <button id="showBoxModel">Click to Start</button>
        <div id="hideBoxModel">
            <p>The box model is a combination of element, padding, border, and margin.Padding is the area between the element itself and its border. Margin is the beyond an element's border separating it from other elements. Border is the line drawn around an elements and can be of any size or color. Similarly the background color of an elements will be visibly within its padding, but not its margin. Any or all of these may have a value of zero. The margin is capable of having negative values.</p>

        <h2>Block & Inline-Block</h2>
        <button id='showInlineBlock'>Click to Start</button>
        <div id="hideInlineBlock">
            <p>These are the two basic display properties that an element may have. Even when an element is set to display flex that only affects its children. That parent element will still express its default display property. Block level elements take up as much room from left to right as their container allows, whether that container is the page itself or another element in which it has been placed. Inline-block elements only take up as much room as their contents.</p>
            <button onclick="window.location.href='./cssPlaygrounds/block.html'">Play</button>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <h2>Position Properties</h2>
        <button id="showPosition">Click to Start</button>
        <div id="hidePosition">
            <p>The position property defines how an element is positioned on the webpage.  There are 5 different types that can be used.</p>
            <button onclick="window.location.href='./cssPlaygrounds/position.html'">Play</button>
        </div>

        <h2>Display Flex</h2>
        <button id="showDisplayFlex">Click to Start</button>
        <div id="hideDisplayFlex">
            <p>Flex is a display property that can be applied to a parent element which will then control its children. It is similar to making all of the children display inline-block, but much more powerful. Flex attributes can be used to justify child elements left to right, align child elements up and down, put gaps between each child element, as well as organizing them into rows or columns.</p>

        <h2>Flex Wrap</h2>
        <button id="showFlexWrap">Click to Start</button>
        <div id="hideFlexWrap">
            <p>Sometimes we have too much stuff, too many elements, to keep them on one line. That's when we need to wrap them. This is also good for accommodating different screen sizes. We see below that elements naturally wrap to the next line when left alone, but lets flex their parent container and see what changes we can make.</p>
